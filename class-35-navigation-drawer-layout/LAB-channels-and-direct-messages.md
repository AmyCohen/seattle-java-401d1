# ![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) Adding Channels and Direct Messages

## Resources
* [Creating a Navigation Drawer](https://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/nav-drawer.html)
* [YouTube: Navigation Drawer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju837bQOBfg)

## Feature Tasks
Continue building on your chat app to add two new features:
* Allow users to create and join different channels for different chat topics
* Allow users to direct message each other

Use a `DrawerLayout` so users can pull the drawer menu out from the side of the
app, and see what channels and direct messages they're involved with.

## Testing
* Add database tests to make sure users have a list of channels they belong to.
* Add database tests to make sure users can send direct messages to each other.

## Documentation
* In your `README.md` include screenshots of your app.
* Include a sample of how information is structured and stored in your Firebase
  database.

## Stretch Goals
Allow users to create group messages where several users are direct messaging
each other all together.
