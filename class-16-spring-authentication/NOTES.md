# Classes
A collection of properties and methods.
A class actually has code inside of it's
methods
Classes can be extended so other classes
inherit their fully-built properties and methods

# Abstract Classes
A partial class where not all methods
are actually defined. Some methods
don't have code and rely on sub-classes
to define code to fill in these empty
spots.

# Interfaces
A collection of properties and methods
that another class **should** have.

An interface defines what something else
must have in order to be considered a
type of thing.

There's an interface called `Iterable`
that classes can `implement` to make
classes targets of forEach loops.
