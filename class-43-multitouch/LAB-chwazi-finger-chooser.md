Create a multi-touch application that allows a group of users to each place a
finger on the phone, waits for some number of fingers to be held down
consistently for some period of time, then randomly choose one finger and
highlights where it's touching on the screen.

Use the Canvas to draw different colored circles around each finger as it presses
and moves around the screen. The winning circle should stay on the screen for some
time before disappearing after being chosen.

Download and play with the Chwazi Finger Choose app to see how it behaves.
