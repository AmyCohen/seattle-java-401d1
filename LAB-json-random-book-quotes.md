# ![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) Popular Book Quotes

## Resources  
* [GSON User Guide](https://github.com/google/gson/blob/master/UserGuide.md)

## Feature Tasks
Use the file `recentquotes.json` to show random popular book quotes on a webpage.
Your program should use `GSON` to parse the .json file. The page needs no
functionality other than showing the quote, and the author. The page should
choose one quote each time the page refreshes.
  
## Testing  
* Use JUnit to write a test for each of the Feature Tasks.

## Documentation
* Provide a brief description of what the application does in `README.md`.
* Include clear instructions of how to install dependencies and run the
  app after someone clones the repo.

## Stretch Goals
Write a program that reads through all of the JSON data in the file containing
"IMDB Most Popular by Year." Tally up each genre for each year and print out
the most popular genre for the year.
