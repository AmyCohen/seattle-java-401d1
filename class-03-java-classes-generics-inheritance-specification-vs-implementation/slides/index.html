# Class 03: Java Classes, Custom Objects, Generics
Reminders:

* Arrays are fixed size
* Lists are built out of arrays
* Sets contain unique values
* Sets are unordered

---
# public static void main(String[] args)
The String array parameter to the main method is there so programs have access
to arguments passed to the program when it runs.

You can create programs that read in user input and do stuff with it!

```java
public class CommandLineTool {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    for (int i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
      System.out.println("Argument #" + i + ": " + args[i]);
    }
  }
}
```

Now you can compile your program on the command line and run it and pass
arguments to it!

```bash
javac CommandLineTool.java
java CommandLineTool these are arguments to the program
```

# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
* This error appears when you try to access an index of an array that doesn't
  exist.
* Remember arrays are indexed starting at `0`
* Arrays never have negative indexes

```java
int[] aa = {0, 1, 2}

aa[0]  // good
aa[1]  // good
aa[2]  // good

aa[-1] // bad!! ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
aa[3]  // bad!! ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
aa[4]  // bad!! ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
aa[99] // bad!! ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
```

# Method Overloading
https://beginnersbook.com/2013/05/method-overloading/

* Java allows us to create multiple methods with the samename.
* Methods with the same name must accept different parameters.
* Java distinguishes between the different methods by looking at the types of
  each parameter

You could make a method that computes the distance from `(0,0)` by default,
and another with the same name that computes the distance between two points.

```
public double distance(int x, int y)
public double distance(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
```

You could define one `pop` method that pops things off the back of a list,
and another `pop` method that pops elements off at a given index.

```
public int pop()
public int pop(int index)
```

# Java Classes
* Java is an **Object-Oriented** language
* Everything is objects!!
* Wait, what the heck are these objy-bois?

* Objects allow you to define your own custom things to use in the language.
* Classes define objects

* Let's make something that represents a 2D Point
  * A point has a `x` value
  * A point has a `y` value
  * A point has a `distance` method

---
# Point

```java
public class Point {
  public int x;
  public int y;

  // the constructor defines how objects are constructed
  public Point(int x, int y) {
    this.x = x;  
    this.y = y;  
  }

  public int distance(int x2, int y2) {
    int dx = this.x - x2;
    int dy = this.y - y2;

    double result = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    return result;
  }
}
```

---
# The Constructor

* The constructor is a special method that defines how objects are created.
* The constructor always has the same name as the class.
* There can be multiple constructors! (via method overloading)

```java
Point origin = new Point();
Point seattle = new Point(47, 122);
```

If someone doesn't provide values program it to default to zero.

```java
public class Point {
  public int x;
  public int y;

  public Point() {
    this.x = 0; 
    this.y = 0;  
  }

  public Point(int x, int y) {
    this.x = x;  
    this.y = y;  
  }
}
```

---
# public vs private
* The `private` keyword restricts access to class internals.
* If you define a property on a class as private then anything outside
  the class file won't be able to access it.

```java
SafetyDepositBox box = new SafetyDepositBox("ilovemom", "The secret bean sauce is dog meat");
box.unlock("1234");      // returns "Access denied!"
box.unlock("ilovemom");  // returns "The secret bean sauce is dog meat"
box.contents             // trying to access .contents is a compilation error
```

```java
public class SafetyDepositBox {
  private String password;
  private String contents;

  public SafetyDepositBox(String password, String contents) {

  }

  public String unlock(String passwordAttempt) {
    if (passwordAttempt.equals(this.password)) {
      return this.contents;
    }
    return "Access denied!";
  }
}
```

# Equality
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7520432/what-is-the-difference-between-vs-equals-in-java

* Java uses the `==` double-equals operator to compare primitive values.
* Java objects use custom `.equals` methods to compare each other.
* If you use `==` double-equals to compare two objects it will return true if
  they're literally the same object at the same memory location.
* The custom `.equals` method will return true if two different instances of
  a class contain the same information.

```
Plato: "Oh my god we both have lattes."
Socrates: "I notice they're very much the same."
Plato: "Yes they are."
Socrates: "Certainly they must be ==."
Plato: "Indeed not. You are holding yours. I am holding mine."
Socrates: "But they're both lattes."
Plato: "Yes. Yours and mine are .equals()"
Socrates: "Ah, I see. Only my latte is == to my own."
```

And thus socrates was enlightened.
