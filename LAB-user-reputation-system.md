## Resources
* [Wikipedia: Reputation System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_system#Attacks_and_defense)

## Feature Tasks
Expand on the Postmates app by adding the ability to rate users and leave
comments about how well they performed a task.

Discuss with your teammates what sort of reputation system you want to
implement. Choices may include:

* Upvotes and downvotes
* 5-star ratings with averages, or showing user's star distributions
* LinkedIn-like skills endorsement for keywords like "speedy" or "friendly"
* Streak-based system where you see if users are on an upward-trend, steady
  trend or downward trend.
* Or anything else!

## Testing  
* Create tests simulating reputations for users
  * Create a test for how a reputation accumulates for a "bad" user
  * Create a test for how a reputation accumulates for a "good" user
  * Create a test for how a reputation accumulates for a "great" user

## Documentation
* In your `README.md` include screenshots of your app.
* Document how your rating system works and how it's modeled in your database.

## Stretch Goals
* Use Firebase messaging to notify users when:
  * Their reputation takes a significant rise or dip
