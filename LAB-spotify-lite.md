## Resources
* [Spotify](http://spotify.com)
* [MDN: The Embed Audio Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio)

Create a web interface like Spotify allowing users to access MP3 files they've
uploaded. Protect other users from accessing MP3 files with user authentication
and authorization.

Build off the previous labs where users interacted with an Artist and Music
database, uploaded files, and where you created an auth system.

# Stretch Goals
* Add a new table to the database to track how many times a user listens to
  each of their songs.
* Add a new table to keep track of when artists and songs were uploaded and
  keep track of dates for each time they've been played. Display this
  information to the user on a webpage where they can see their "most-listened-to"
  stats.
* Leverage your web-scraping, album-art-fetching API to display album art
  for artists and songs as they play.
* Modify the site to allow users to upload videos! Create a new table in the
  database to store movies associated with a user. Create a new HTML template
  to allow users to interact with their videos. Refer to MDN docs about the
  HTML5 `<video>` tag to figure out how to display videos on a page.
