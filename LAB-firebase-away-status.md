# ![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) Firebase Realtime Away Status

## Resources  
* [Firebase Structured Data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/android/structure-data)
* [Read and Write Data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/android/read-and-write)
* [Working with Lists of Data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/android/lists-of-data)

Create an Android app that allows users to set their away status. The firebase
should store the user's chosen username, and a message they want to convey to
other users.

Users should be able to set their own username and set their own away status.
Users should be able to see the away status of all other users.

An away status should be something simple like, "grabbing a sandwich, back in 10."
