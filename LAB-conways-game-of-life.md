## Resources  
* [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
* [Glider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(Conway%27s_Life))
* [Gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_(cellular_automaton))

## Feature Tasks
Create an application that simulates Conway's Game of Life. Display the
simulation on a Canvas view and pick some practical assumptions for the size
of the cell (like 50 pixels, or something).

Add play/step/pause/clear buttons to allow users to play the simulation,
watch it move step by step and easily reset it.

## Testing  
* Write JUnit tests for small boards that verify cells are born, live and die
  correctly.

## Documentation
Find a tool to make an animated GIF of your app in action and add it to your
`README.md`. You can screen yourself using the app in the emulator and then
convert short clips of that movie into a GIF, or try displaying the movie
itself on the GitHub README.

## Stretch Goals
* Add several tools that allow users to populate the board with different
  initial configurations like:
  * randomly populating the entire board with an adjustable `NN%` percent
    probability
  * Allowing users to tap, or press and drag around to draw live cells on to
    the board.
  * Allow users to play/pause the simulation and adjust it's playback speed
* Include notable initial setups for users to see like:
  * Stable set ups
  * Gliders
  * Guns
