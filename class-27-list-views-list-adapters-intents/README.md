## Reading
This is a lot of reading. You don't have to read it word for word, but please
peruse the chapters and try to gain a general understanding of what Fragments
are and how Lists are created in Android. Extra-good sections with shorter
reading spans are called out specifically, like the section about Singletons.

* Read Big Nerd Ranch
* **Your Second Activity** (pages 91-112)
* **UI Fragments** (pages 123-156)
* **Displaying Lists with RecyclerView** (pages 157-180)
* **Singletons and centralized data storage** (pages 159-160)
* **An abstract Activity class** (pages 162-164)
* Gain an understanding of `Fragments` vs `Activites`
* When and why were `Fragments` first introduced to Android?
* What advantage does creating an Abstract Activity class with a single abstract
  method to define a fragment offer?
* What parts do the following classes play when showing lists?
  * `RecyclerView`
  * `ViewHolder`
  * `Adapter`
