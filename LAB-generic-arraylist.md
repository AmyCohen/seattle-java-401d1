# ![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) Generic Array List

## Feature Tasks
Upgrade your ArrayList to use Java Generics. Use Generics to Parameterize it so
it will work with any type of object, not just integers.

## Resources  
* [Generics in Java, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generics_in_Java])
* [Java Generics Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/index.html)
* [Tutorials Point Java Generics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_generics.htm)
  
## Testing  
* Use JUnit to write several tests showing how your implementation works with:
  * ints
  * Strings
  * A custom objects
  * primitive Arrays
  * Your own new generic ArrayList of your own generic ArrayLists!

## Documentation
Include useful comments in your code clarifying any non-obvious programming
decisions.
