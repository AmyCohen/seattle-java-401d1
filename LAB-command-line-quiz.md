## Resources
* [Java Scanner docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html)

Read user input with `Scanner` as if you were reading a file. Just create a
Scanner with `System.in`:

```java
Scanner userInput = new Scanner(System.in);
```

## Feature Tasks
- Create an "About Me" quiz that runs in the command line
- Your solution should include the following:
    - Main method + at *least* 2 other methods
      - minimum 1 method with a non-void return type
      - minimum 1 method with a void return type (excluding main())
    - Minimum 2 different variables with different data types
    - Request user input
    - Receive user response
    - Provide responses back to console based
    - Iterative statements
    - Selective statements
    - Track number of correct/incorrect questions
      - Show the user the number of correct/incorrect to user after quiz is over

## Rubric
- 3pts: Application runs without any errors
- 2pts: Request user input and output response
- 2pts: min 2 methods not `main()`
- 2pt: Iterative/Selective statements - logical code flow
- 1pt: README included with answers to questions

## Testing
* Test your quiz by passing it a scanner on text representing user input.
