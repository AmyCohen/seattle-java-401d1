# ![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) Simple Static, Greeting Page, and Server Clock Site

## Resources  
* [Serving Web Content with Spring MVC](https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/)

## Feature Tasks
Use Spring to quickly create and deploy a static site to Heroku. Add a page
that has a parameterized route that can greet someone with their name provided
in the URL. Add another page that uses a server-side template to display the
time on the server.

## Testing
* Write a test that downloads the page and verifies there's a default greeting.
* Write a test that provides a custom name as a URL parameter and download the
  page to make sure it displays the custom greeting.

## Documentation
Include a link to your live published/deployed site in the `README.md` file.

## Stretch Goals
Write a program that reads through all of the JSON data in the file containing
"IMDB Most Popular by Year." Tally up each genre for each year and print out
the most popular genre for the year.
