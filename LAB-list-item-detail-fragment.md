# ![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) List Item Detail Fragment

## Resources
* [Building a Dynamic UI with Fragments](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/fragments/index.html)
* [Implement Master/Detail Flows](https://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/descendant.html)

## Feature Tasks
Create an application that has a list view on the left and a fragment detail
view on the right. Swap out the fragment when the user selects a different item
from the list view on the left.

You have the freedom to choose what sort of theme, or what sort of information
you want to display in this app.

Here are some ideas:
* Dictionary: words on the left, definitions on the right
* Sports Play Book: list of plays on the left, fancy football diagrams on the right.
* Cafe Kiosk: list of items to order on the left, tracking items and total on
  the right.
  
Have fun with it! See what you can do.

## Testing
No testing for this lab.

## Documentation
Write a brief description of your app and include screenshots in your
`README.md` showing the app in several states.

## Stretch Goals
Do it twice! Create another Activity in your app that displays Detail
Fragments for a set of different information.
