## Resources  
* [Cricket (darts)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_(darts))

Use Android's canvas to draw a dartboard. Write logic to allow users to drag
and tap their finger around to set scores. Follow the rules of cricket where
players are only aiming for 15-20, and the bullseye and only score points when
they've closed a point-bracket out (by hitting it three times).

Input up to the three shots each player is allowed to take and send that
information to the server. The server should intercept the data, compare it
to data in Firebase already, and process the Firebase data to update the scores
for everyone. Allow the Firebase changes to automatically propagate back to
the phone.
