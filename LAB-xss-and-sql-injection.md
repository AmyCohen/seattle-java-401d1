## Resources
* [Java SQL Injection](https://free.codebashing.com/free-content/java/sql_injection)
* [Android Security](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-tips.html)

## Feature Tasks
Go to <https://free.codebashing.com/free-content/java/sql_injection> and run through their interactive
SQL demo.

Access the demo Android application which has raw SQL queries and perform a
security audit.

* Launch the application and navigate around to see the general layout and use
  of the application.
* Look through the source code to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* Pay special attention to anywhere users enter input.
* Craft your own malicious user input to take advantage of the security
  vulnerabilities in the application.
* Make changes to the application fixing the security holes.

## Testing
No testing for this lab.

## Documentation
Provide examples of malicious SQL queries and describe how they were able to
take advantage of security flaws in the app.

* What was the malicious query?
* What data were you able to access with the malicious query?
* How can the app be modified to secure itself against this attack?

## Stretch Goals
* Find one of your previous applications and document a security flaw in it.
